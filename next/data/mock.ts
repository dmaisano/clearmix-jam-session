    name: "BERNESE MOUNTAIN DOG - Characteristics and Care",
    description:
      "The Bernese Mountain Dog, sometimes known as the Bernese Cattle Dog, is a large sized dog with an even bigger personality. They are very calm, docile and loving dogs, making them particularly popular as family dogs, especially those with a lot of room to spare. They will be great to snuggle up with on the sofa, but that is only as long as they have had the right amount of exercise and are given enough mental stimulation to meet their intelligent character. Here at AnimalWised we bring you the characteristics of the Bernese Mountain Dog. We also provide information on what sort of care needs you can expect if you adopt one into your own family, including health expectations. As you will see, they are a dog which will get on with anyone, but, practically, they are not for everyone.
